<span style="white-space: nowrap">Two booklets</span> by Roger Parsons about Glastonbury&rsquo;s once-eminent Porch family</h2>


<p>The Porch dynasty was one of Glastonbury&rsquo;s wealthiest clans in the 19th century. Their fortune was made first in the wool trade then through banking and favourable marriages, such as into the Reeves family who owned the Abbey ruins and built Abbey House. Meanwhile the Porches enlarged their residence at Edgarley on the other side of the Tor, preserving many fine pieces of carved Abbey stone there. Many a Mayor of Glastonbury was a Porch.</p>

<p>Infamy and downfall came in the early 20th century when a Porch heiress married a ne&rsquo;er-do-well playboy, poisoned him in Japan but was spared the gallows &mdash; it made international headlines at the time, and the Porches soon left Edgarley, never to return.</p>

<p>Roger Parsons has thoroughly researched the family records during his years as archivist and teacher at Millfield Prep School, sited on the former Porch estate since 1945. His first booklet, <b><i>Victorian Edgarley: the fall of the House of Porch</i></b>, came out in 2010, followed by a second edition in 2014. A web edition is being prepared.</p>

<p>A matching booklet &mdash; <b><i>Montie Porch, a charmed life: the Glastonbury man who married Winston Churchill&rsquo;s mother</i></b> &mdash; followed in 2012, reprinted in 2015. A second edition (2019) is now <a href="montie/">on the web</a>.</p>

<p>Only a handful of printed copies are left (&pound;5 each; profits to charity); contact Abbey Press. Alternatively, ask <a href="mailto:111114@abbeypress.net">Abbey Press</a> for a PDF file (no charge) from which you can print your own copy.</p>

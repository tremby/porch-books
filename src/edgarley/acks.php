<p>I am honour-bound to acknowledge the contribution of others to the history you are reading..</p>

<p>When I started this project, despite some splendid groundwork by Simon Fuller, our late, great head of history here at Millfield Prep School, I was faced with the problem of having no member of the Edgarley Porches living locally or, from what I could tell, nationally, to turn to for information or inspiration, and no clue as to how to discover them, if indeed there were any to discover.</p>

<p>This was resolved by the old school network: one of Albert&rsquo;s sons, Robert Bagehot Porch (of whom more later) had been a teacher for many years at Malvern College. Also a teacher at Malvern is a former Millfield pupil, John Knee, and it was John who alerted me to the connection between Malvern and Edgarley. It was through John that I was able to make contact with Robert&rsquo;s son Alec (therefore Albert&rsquo;s grandson), also an Old Malvernian, now in his 80s, but a sharp-minded ex-headmaster and, crucially, keeper of the Porch history. So my thanks to John, and to Alec for the copious notes on the family which were essential to this paper.</p>

<p>There are others, including some members of the family who have gradually appeared along the way, to whom I also owe a debt of gratitude. These are Richard J. Porch, one of Albert&rsquo;s great-grandsons, for his encouragement, support and great kindness, and Sally Melia, great-granddaughter of Albert&rsquo;s younger brother Reginald, who has kindly provided me with some of the photos you will see later from her family records.</p>

<p>I must also thank Janita Clamp for lending me all the notes and photos she collected in the 1980s for her father, the late Professor Clamp of Bristol University, on behalf of Professor Tokuoka of Yokohama. Professor Tokuoka was the author of the original Japanese version of the book <i>Murder on the Bluff</i>, which was translated and adapted for publication in England by Molly Whittington-Egan.</p>

<p>My thanks also go to my archivist colleague at Millfield Senior School, Dr Dick Shilton, for his invaluable help in digitizing and improving the quality of many of the photographs I can show you.</p>

<p>As regards other sources for the booklet, I have consulted the National Records Office in Kew, Somerset County Records Office and Studies Library in Taunton, contemporary editions of the <i>West of England Advertiser</i> and the <i>Central Somerset Gazette</i>, Armynell Goodall&rsquo;s book on the Bulleids of Glastonbury and the book on Stuckey&rsquo;s Bank by P.&nbsp;T.&nbsp;Saunders.</p>

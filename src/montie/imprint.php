<h2>Author&rsquo;s note</h2>

<p>The book&rsquo;s title was originally <i>Monty Porch: a charmed life</i>, but this new edition uses the spelling <i>Montie</i> throughout. Having recently had access to a further quantity of Montie&rsquo;s personal papers, the author acknowledges his previous <i>-y</i> spelling to be incorrect, though it is common in newspapers and other sources. The undoubted preference of the man himself and the family is &ldquo;Montie&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Otherwise this edition has comparatively minor revisions. Several photos are improved; the one from the Durbar race at Zaria and the one at Glastonbury cemetery were not in the first edition.</p>
